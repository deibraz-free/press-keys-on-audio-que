# press-keys-on-audio-que
Press keyboard keys on when a recording is being heard

This code was written for a very specific task - bypassibg university projects task silly audio clasification system by randomly pressing "Correct"/"Incorrect" buttons when a recording has been heard, after some delay.

Might be useful for some time-deprived students somewhere out there.

Ran on Python v3.8

Used packages:
* sounddevice - to get sound stream
* numpy - to get the volume
* pynput - to handle keyboard tasks
